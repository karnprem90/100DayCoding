/**
 * In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
 *
 * Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= words.length <= 100
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
 * order.length == 26
 * All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.
